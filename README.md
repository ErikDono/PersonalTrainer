## Future Deploys:

As of right now, the only funtion that works is adding in a new Workout and Routine. I was sucessful in implimeiting the routes for this, and making sure that the date transferred over. However i noticed that duration comes back as undefine despite it matching the necessary 'Number' requirement in the squema. I also struggled to get the other aspect of the site functioning. Until next time!
